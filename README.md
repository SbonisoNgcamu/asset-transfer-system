asset transfer and tracking system
Any item owned by a company that can move between locations or people
for simplicity, we define assets as:
  Laptop
  Vehicle
  Machines
  Equipment
But technically, an asset is just a record with ID.
exampe data:
  AssetID: 123-SD-S23
  AssetName: Dell Latitude 5420
  Type: Laptop
  CurrentLocation: Richards Bay
  Status: Active
No physical complexity.
This is software logic, not logistics.


A Transfer is:  
  Moving an asset from one locaion to another
Example:
  From: Durban Office
  To: Johannesburg Branch
  Requested by: Admin
  Status: Pending / Approved/ Completed

This is Exactly what companies do daily.

The system will:
  Store assets
  Store locations
  Transfer assets between locations
  Track transfer history
  Suppot bulk transfers later(for large number of transfers for items moved from same location to same destination)
